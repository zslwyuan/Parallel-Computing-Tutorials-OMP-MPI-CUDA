# Parallel-Computing-Tutorials-OMP-MPI-CUDA
These are the implementations of the previous assignments from the course COMP 5212 Parallel Computing. Various solutions have been tried and current source codes are based on those get the highest performance on the server. These source codes cover the range from OMP, MPI to CUDA. Thanks to Prof. LUO's detailed lectures and TAs' patient guide.
